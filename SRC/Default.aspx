    <h1>Welcome to the Development Project A</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>The Team...</h2>
    This is the senior project for Team Cache at CSUS, completing at the end of the Fall 2013 semester.  The team is comprised of five individuals:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>Katelyn Lindsay (Project Manager)</li>
        <li>John Couch</li>
        <li>Zack Brown</li>
        <li>Randell Koen</li>
        <li>Kiet Vo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The purpose...</h2>
    The goal of the project is to build a "low-cost", web-based, project management tool that is usable by any device.  This includes devices such as PC's, tablets, iPad's, iPhone's, Android systems, windows-based tablets and phones, etc.<br />

    <h2>What can you do?</h2>
    The tool will allow you to track multiple projects at a glance and then be able to drill down into multiple different objectives.  It allows objectives to be drilled-down further into more sub-objectives, and so on.  Each objective can be weighted to show importance as well, which takes into account the total project completion.<br />
    <br />
    Multiple people can contribute to your projects, and can be easily added and assigned roles and permissions.  Communication can further occurr inside of the private Discussion boards that exist for each individual project.<br />
    <br />
    The tool is built with modular designs in mind, so it is easily expandable for new and exciting capabilities.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>To use this tool...</h2>
    A simple package will be delivered, including the SQL statements needed to set up the MS SQL Database, as well as the website pages themselves.  This home page can be re-modified to fit your business-need, as it is just a sample home page.
